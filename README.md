A high-performance, futuristic portfolio designed specifically for **AI Engineers**, **Data Scientists**, and **ML Developers**. This project transforms the traditional resume into an interactive "System Interface" experience.

## 🚀 Interactive Experience

### 🌌 Starry Hero Section
A minimalist, high-impact landing page featuring:
- **Playfair Display Typography**: Premium serif font for a "Digital Architect" feel.
- **Animated Star Field**: A dynamic, looping background that sets a futuristic tone.
- **Micro-Animations**: Smooth fade-ins and scale effects on hover.

### 🤖 LLM Chatbot Integration (About Section)
The "About" section is reimagined as an **AI Assistant interface**:
- **Typewriter Effect**: Streams your bio in real-time as if generated by a model.
- **RAG Visuals**: Displays your skills as "Retrieved Context" from a Vector DB.
- **System Status**: Shows "Thinking" states and "Confidence Scores".

### 📊 Thematic Overhaul
Every section has been refactored with AI/Data Science metaphors:
- **Experience** → *Model Training Logs* (Holographic timeline of career growth)
- **Projects** → *Inference Nodes* (Live deployment cards with status indicators)
- **Education** → *Knowledge Base Ingestion* (Visualizing academic data ingestion)
- **Achievements** → *Benchmark Visualizations* (Dynamic certification logos from official sources)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Astro v4.x**: For lightning-fast static generation and sub-second load times.
- **Tailwind CSS v4**: For the custom AI design system and utility-driven animations.
- **Three.js**: Powering the 3D neural network visualizations.
- **Wikimedia & Clearbit APIs**: For dynamic, high-quality company branding.

## ⚙️ Quick Customization

The entire portfolio is data-driven. You only need to edit **one file**:

#### `src/config.ts`

```typescript
export const siteConfig = {
  name: "Your Name",
  title: "AI Engineer",
  aboutMe: "Your bio here...",
  skills: ["Python", "PyTorch", "RAG", "LLMs"],
  projects: [...],
  experience: [...],
  education: [...]
};
```

## 🏗️ Local Development

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start Dev Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Build for Production**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
